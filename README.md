# Introduction:
The Nifty 50, often simply referred to as the Nifty, is the flagship stock market index of the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE). It comprises the top 50 actively traded stocks from various sectors, representing a diversified and comprehensive reflection of the Indian equity market. Investors and analysts closely monitor the Nifty 50 to gauge the overall market sentiment, economic health, and investment opportunities in India.

## Aim of the project ðŸŽ¯:
The aim of this project is to develop a robust linear regression model for predicting stock prices based on historical data. The primary focus will be on creating an accurate and efficient linear regression model that can analyze historical stock prices and relevant features to make reliable predictions about future stock values. Once the model is trained and validated, the objective is to save the linear regression model to a file, enabling seamless and rapid predictions for future stock prices. By achieving this goal, the project aims to provide investors and financial analysts with a valuable tool for making data-driven decisions in the stock market.

## Project Description ðŸ“ƒ:
The "Linear Regression Model for Stock Price Predictions" project focuses on creating a predictive model using linear regression techniques to forecast stock prices. This project revolves around analyzing historical stock data, developing a linear regression model based on this data, and saving the trained model for future predictions. The goal is to provide accurate predictions for stock prices, aiding investors and traders in making informed decisions about buying or selling stocks.

#### Key Steps in the Project:
1. Data Collection:
  - Gather historical stock price data, including features like opening price, closing price, trading volume, and any other relevant metrics.

2. Data Preprocessing:
  - Clean and preprocess the collected data, handling missing values and outliers. Prepare the data in a format suitable for training a linear regression model, ensuring numerical features are normalized if needed.

3. Feature Selection:
  - Identify relevant features that influence stock prices. Common features include historical prices, trading volume, moving averages, and technical indicators. Select features that have significant correlations with stock prices.

4. Linear Regression Model:
  - Implement a linear regression model using libraries like scikit-learn in Python. Train the model on the preprocessed historical data, mapping features to stock prices using linear relationships.

5. Model Training and Evaluation:
  - Split the data into training and testing sets. Train the linear regression model using the training data and evaluate its performance on the test data. Utilize metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to assess the model's accuracy.

6. Saving the Model:
   - Once the linear regression model demonstrates satisfactory performance, save the trained model to a file using serialization techniques. Common formats include pickle files in Python or joblib files, preserving the model's state and parameters.

7. Real-time Predictions:
  - Implement a mechanism to load the saved model and use it for real-time predictions. Users can input relevant features (such as current trading volume and historical prices), and the model will output the predicted stock price.
